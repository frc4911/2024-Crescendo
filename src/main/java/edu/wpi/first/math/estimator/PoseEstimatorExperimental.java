/**
 * This class wraps {@link Odometry} to fuse latency-compensated vision measurements with encoder
 * measurements. Robot code should not use this directly- Instead, use the particular type for your
 * drivetrain (e.g., {@link DifferentialDrivePoseEstimator}). It is intended to be a drop-in
 * replacement for {@link Odometry}; in fact, if you never call {@link
 * PoseEstimatorExperimental#addVisionMeasurement} and only call {@link
 * PoseEstimatorExperimental#update} then this will behave exactly the same as Odometry.
 *
 * <p>{@link PoseEstimatorExperimental#update} should be called every robot loop.
 *
 * <p>{@link PoseEstimatorExperimental#addVisionMeasurement} can be called as infrequently as you
 * want; if you never call it then this class will behave exactly like regular encoder odometry.
